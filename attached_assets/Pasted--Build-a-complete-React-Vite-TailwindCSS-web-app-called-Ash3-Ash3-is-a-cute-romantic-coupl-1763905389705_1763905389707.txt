**Build a complete React + Vite + TailwindCSS web app called “Ash3.”
Ash3 is a cute, romantic, couple-friendly bucket-list website for two people.
No login or backend. All data must be saved in localStorage.**

## 🌸 *Branding + Logo (Important)*

Create a *cute, aesthetic logo* for the Ash3 brand.

*Logo Requirements:*

* Combine *“Ash”* and *“3”* in a creative overlapping style
* “3” should blend into the letters like a couple in a hug
* Use soft curves and pastel colors
* Add tiny sparkles or a small heart for cuteness
* Main theme color: *#FF80AB (rose pink)*
* Provide:

  * *SVG file*
  * *React component* → Logo.jsx
* Must look adorable, minimal, and couple-friendly
* Scales well for navbar & mobile

Use this logo in the navbar and splash/home screens.

## 🎀 *UI Style Requirements*

Create a *romantic, cute, pastel interface*:

* Soft pink theme (#FF80AB)
* Rounded corners (20–32px)
* Heart icons and soft gradients
* Framer Motion animations everywhere
* Buttons with bounce/scale animations
* Confetti animation when an item is completed
* Use *Poppins* or *Inter* for a soft, clean look
* Fully responsive (mobile-first)

Make the entire UI feel cozy, warm, and perfect for couples.
